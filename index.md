This project revives and modernizes the development experience for **AMX Mod X** scripters. If you love creating plugins for Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6, and other GoldSrc mods but miss modern tools, this extension is for you.

It transforms VS Code into a powerful IDE for Pawn, bringing features that were previously exclusive to newer languages.

## ✨ What's New (v1.1.7)

* **Visual Bug Fix:** The extension will no longer incorrectly underline `#include` directives that contain spaces (e.g., `#include < fun >`).

---

## ✨ Key Features

This extension goes far beyond simple syntax highlighting. It offers a complete **Language Server** with:

* **Advanced IntelliSense:** Autocomplete for functions, constants, and variables.
* **Smart Code Navigation (`Go to Definition`):** Press `Ctrl+Click` to instantly jump to the definition of:
    * Functions (including `public`, `stock`, `native`, and those with an `@` prefix).
    * Constants defined with `#define`.
    * Global variables.
    * **Functions in Tasks:** Navigate directly to the function when its name is passed as a string (e.g., `set_task_ex(..., "my_function", ...)`).
* **Hover Information:** Hover over a function or variable to see its full definition without leaving your current context.
* **Real-time Diagnostics:** The extension warns you if an `#include` cannot be found, helping you fix errors before you even compile.
* **Integrated Compilation:** Compile your plugins directly from VS Code with a single command.

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  Open the **Extensions** tab (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3.  Search for `AMXXPawn Language Service`.
4.  Click **Install**.
5.  Reload VS Code and enjoy!

You can also install it directly from the [Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iceeedR.amxx-pawn-language-editor).

## ⚙️ Configuration (Essential Step!)

For the extension to work 100%, you **must** tell it where your AMXX compiler and `include` files are located.

1.  Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl + ,`).
2.  Click the "Open settings.json" icon in the upper-right corner.
3.  Add the following properties to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    // ...other settings...

    // Path to the amxxpc compiler executable.
    "amxxpawn.compiler.executablePath": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\compiler\\amxxpc.exe",

    // List of folders where the extension should look for .inc files.
    // ESSENTIAL for "Go to Definition" of native functions to work.
    "amxxpawn.compiler.includePaths": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\your\\compiler\\include"
    ]

    // --- RECOMMENDED SETTING ---
    // For a cleaner and smarter autocomplete experience,
    // disable generic suggestions based on words in the file.
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": "off"
}
IMPORTANT for Windows users: In JSON files, you must use double backslashes (\\) or forward slashes (/) in paths.

Practical Example:

JSON

{
    "amxxpawn.compiler.executablePath": "C:/AMXX/compiler/amxxpc.exe",
    "amxxpawn.compiler.includePaths": [
        "C:/AMXX/compiler/include"
    ]
}
⌨️ Available Commands
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type AMXXPawn to see the available commands:

AMXXPawn: Compile Plugin: Compiles the currently open .sma file using the executablePath defined in the settings.

AMXXPawn: Compile Plugin Local: Searches for and uses an amxxpc.exe located in the same folder as the .sma file you are editing.
